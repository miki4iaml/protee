## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project skeleton: the `protee` package (typed, version read from the
  installed distribution), Python 3.14 or later, BSD-3-Clause.
- Rules shared by contributors and coding agents (`AGENTS.md`), the
  contributing guide in English and French, and the security policy.
- Local checks (pre-commit hooks: formatting, lint, typing, tests,
  secrets, anonymity, image metadata, hidden characters and local-only
  files), replayed by CI on Ubuntu and Windows with Python 3.14 and
  3.15, with an 80 % branch coverage floor.
- Release workflow: build checked, provenance and SBOM attested,
  publication through Trusted Publishing.
- First algorithms, pure Python, provisional API until version 1.0
  (`import protee` loads the subpackages on demand):
  - `protee.graph`: immutable directed multigraph (parallel arcs and
    loops), topology only;
  - `protee.paths`: Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford with a negative cycle as
    certificate;
  - `protee.flow`: maximum flow (Dinic, Edmonds-Karp) with a minimum cut;
    feasibility with a violated cut as certificate (Gale, Hoffman);
    minimum or maximum cost flow with bounds and supplies by three named
    methods, always chosen by the caller (`network_simplex` with strongly
    feasible trees and a warm start on new costs, `cycle_canceling`,
    `successive_shortest_paths`), sharing one result: status, integer
    flow, potentials, certificate, deterministic counters; `k` node- or
    arc-disjoint paths of minimum total cost;
  - `protee.flow.diagnostics`: least and greatest flow of each arc (over
    the feasible or the optimal flows), unattainable bounds, exact test
    of the uniqueness of an optimum;
  - `protee.structure`: weak and strong components, degree-2 paths and
    their contraction (protected nodes, per-attribute aggregation,
    expansion), spanning forest, fundamental cycles;
  - `protee.transforms`: reversible transformations of flow problems
    (lower bounds removed, node splitting, subdivision, super-source and
    super-sink with a return arc, path contraction);
  - `protee.io`: node-link JSON, CSV table of arcs, DIMACS minimum cost
    flow format.
- Tests against independent oracles (NetworkX, HiGHS, enumeration) and
  reproducible property-based tests (Hypothesis).
